Anonopedia is a collection of privacy focussed guides, articles & tips, authored in order to keep a personal 'instruction manual' to ensure I dont forget how to repeat previously completed projects & tasks.

With the size of my personal projects continously growing, it was no longer sustainable to post these guides on Twitter, which in turn led to the eventual birth of anonopedia.

As the site grows my hopes are that this journal will also prove useful to others attempting to improve their online privacy fingerprint.

Enjoy :)
